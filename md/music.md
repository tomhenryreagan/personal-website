# Music 
Drumming is my favorite hobby. 

Listen to my band's extremely lo-fi demotape: [SÇRÖD demo](https://scrod.bandcamp.com/album/demo)

Watch some videos of me playing, hopefully with more to come:

- [My Drum Vlog](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-uhC8JKmygn7aODeMwLYt__QEcxnc_hX)
- [SÇRÖD - Full Set (Live at Somerville PorchFest)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n-ofFXPsRyw)
- [Teddy Picker (Drum Cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ypsmg5IhJ4)
- [You Don't Know Me // Farinha Do Desprezo (Full Band Cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVYjzgHf-c)

My top album of this month is Earth Tongue's [Great Haunting](https://earthtongue.bandcamp.com/album/great-haunting), which appears not to have made its way into the metadata infrastructure yet. I strongly recommend checking out the release and supporting them on Bandcamp.
