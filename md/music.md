# Music 
Drumming is my favorite hobby. 

Listen to my band's extremely lo-fi demotape: [SCROD demo](https://scrod.bandcamp.com/album/demo)

Watch some videos of me playing, hopefully with more to come:

- [Teddy Picker (Drum Cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Ypsmg5IhJ4)
- [You Don't Know Me // Farinha Do Desprezo (Full Band Cover)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQVYjzgHf-c)
