Hello, I'm TomHenry.

This website is mostly for me to share my hobbies, which include: [playing
the drums and exploring new music](/music.html); [taking portraits of
squirrels](/photos.html); and [hacking around on GNU/Linux](/setup.html). 

By trade, I am an electrical engineer. My job is to design computer processors. There's a decent chance you are reading this using a circuit I've helped to design.

Currently, I am based near Boston, MA. Previously, I spent several years in CO, and grew up in my bucolic, non-rhotic home state of ME.
