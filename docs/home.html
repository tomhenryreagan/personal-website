<p>I’m an electrical engineer interested in using physical design strategies to overcome fundamental
challenges in small-node processor design.
Currently, I work as a VLSI engineer at Advanced Micro Devices, where I perform the physical design of CPU core logic.
I hold a B.S in Electrical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines, which allegedly qualifies me for my job.
I also attended the Maine School of Science &amp; Mathematics, which apparently qualifies me to be my friends’ point-of-contact for advice on purchasing winter tires.
Though this site will mostly be dedicated to my engineering projects, I also reserve the right to post uninteresting content about drumming, climbing, backpacking, intentional living, and my pet rats.</p>
