<p>I find peace and purpose through making meaningful connections with my natural environment.
These connections usually take the form of observing wild places, caring for plants, and befriending animals who coinhabit my frequented spaces.
This page contains several nature-y photos I have taken which make me feel a little more at home in the outdoors. Perhaps you may enjoy them, too.</p>
<h3 id="squirrels">Squirrels</h3>
<p>Yes, my squirrel friends let me get quite close to them. I have spent over a year building their trust and becoming their friends. Please do not
feed wild squirrels by hand, chase after them for photos, or entice them with plentiful/unhealthy treats. Please do love and appreciate the squirrels you see
in your local parks. They are curious, kind, and clever animals. By observing them in a local park, you can learn a lot about the inner workings of the ecosystem you inhabit.</p>
