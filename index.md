It feels like Moore's Law is about to end and, as an electrical engineer, I am very excited to have front-row tickets to the event.
I am interested in exploring how novel VLSI design techniques can be used to improve computational performance without relying on ever-smaller process nodes.

Currently, I work on the physical design of floating point CPU core logic at AMD. I also hold a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines. 

Though this site will mostly be dedicated to my engineering projects, I also reserve the right to post uninteresting content about music, the outdoors, and whatever else I feel motivated to write about.
