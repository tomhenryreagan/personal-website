### *Tapeouts on tapeouts on tapeouts*

I'm an electrical engineer interested in using physical design strategies to overcome fundamental 
challenges in small-node processor design. 

Currently, I work as a VLSI engineer at Advanced Micro Devices, where I perform the physical design of CPU core logic.

I hold a B.S in Electrical Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines, which allegedly qualifies me for my job. 

I also attended the Maine School of Science & Mathematics, which probably would have qualified me to join the Shackleton expedition.

Though this site will mostly be dedicated to my engineering projects, I also reserve the right to post uninteresting content about drumming, climbing, backpacking, intentional living, and my pet rats.
