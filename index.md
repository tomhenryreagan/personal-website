Hello, I'm TomHenry, and I'm an electrical engineer who works with integrated circuits. 

Currently, I am a graduate student at Harvard University, where I study neuromorphic engineering with the [Donhee Ham Lab](https://www.donheehamlab.org/). 
Previously, I got a few tapeouts under my belt as a member of the CPU core physical design team at AMD, and completed my undergraduate education at the Colorado School of Mines. 
I am also an alum of the Maine School of Science and Mathematics in my bucolic, non-rhotic, home state.

Outside of engineering, I am also a drummer, outdoorsman, and GNU/Linux advocate. 
I would be happy to strike up a conversation with you about any of these topics.
